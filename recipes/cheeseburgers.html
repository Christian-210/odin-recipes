    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Growing up I had one food love that, no matter the situation, style of
      restaurant, or time of day, completely stole my heart: the Almighty
      Cheeseburger. There's just something magical about that handheld goodness
      that makes us instantly happier. When I started cooking, a juicy,
      cooked-to-perfection burger was on my top-ten list of things to
      master.This recipe is for a classic, diner-style burger with all my
      favorite toppings. Adding a mustard layer to the beef before frying
      creates the most insanely delicious crust—you'll be an immediate convert.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground chuck (80% lean)</li>
      <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
      <li>Sea salt</li>
      <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
      <li>4 or 8 Homemade Brioche Burger Buns (see Note)</li>
      <li>1/3 cup yellow mustard</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>8 slices American cheese</li>
      <li>4 to 8 (1/4-inch-thick) tomato slices</li>
      <li>4 to 8 (1/4-inch-thick) red onion slices</li>
      <li>8 pickle slices</li>
      <li>8 burger-size lettuce leaves</li>
      <li>Maple Curry Ketchup, for serving (see Note)</li>
      <li>Spicy Herb Homemade Mayo, for serving (see Note)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the ground chuck and sirloin and mix gently but
        thoroughly. Divide into eight equal portions and shape them into burger
        patties (see opposite for tips). Season both sides with salt and pepper
        and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>

      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Split and toast the buns in the
        pan until toasty and golden brown. Set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove the burgers from the fridge and place a thumbprint in the center
        of each patty. Smear 1 teaspoon of the mustard on both sides of each
        patty (best burger crust ever). Melt the butter in the preheated pan
        and, working in batches, fry the burgers for 3 to 4 minutes on each
        side, until a dark brown crust begins to form. The result: perfectly
        juicy medium-cooked burgers. For folks who prefer their burgers a little
        more well done, fry for 5 to 6 minutes per side.
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer the patties to a baking sheet as they’re done. Top each with
        cheese and place in the oven to melt, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Build the burgers on the toasted buns with 1 or 2 burger patties, a
        slice of tomato, pickles, a slice of red onion, and lettuce. Top each
        with ketchup or mayo. Or both. Serve immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
